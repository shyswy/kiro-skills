- `aws-agentic-ai` — AWS Bedrock AgentCore comprehensive expert for deploying and managing AI agents at scale. Use when working with any AgentCore service including Gateway, Runtime, Memory, Identity, Code Interpreter, Browser, Observability, Agent Registry, or Evaluations. Covers agent deployment, MCP tool integration, credential management, agent discovery, governance workflows, and automated quality assessment. Essential when user mentions AgentCore, agent runtime, agent registry, agent evaluation, MCP gateway, deploy agent, register MCP server, discover agents, evaluate agent quality, agent credentials, or wants to build, deploy, catalog, or monitor AI agents on AWS.
- `aws-cdk-development` — AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) expert for building cloud infrastructure with TypeScript/Python. Use when creating CDK stacks, defining CDK constructs, implementing infrastructure as code, or when the user mentions CDK, CloudFormation, IaC, cdk synth, cdk deploy, or wants to define AWS infrastructure programmatically. Covers CDK app structure, construct patterns, stack composition, and deployment workflows.
- `aws-cost-operations` — AWS cost optimization, monitoring, and operational excellence expert. Use when analyzing AWS bills, estimating costs, setting up CloudWatch alarms, querying logs, auditing CloudTrail activity, or assessing security posture. Essential when user mentions AWS costs, spending, billing, budget, pricing, CloudWatch, observability, monitoring, alerting, CloudTrail, audit, or wants to optimize AWS infrastructure costs and operational efficiency.
- `aws-lambda` — "Design, build, deploy, test, and debug serverless applications with AWS Lambda. Triggers on phrases like: Lambda function, event source, serverless application, API Gateway, EventBridge, Step Functions, serverless API, event-driven architecture, Lambda trigger. For deploying non-serverless apps to AWS, use deploy-on-aws plugin instead."
- `aws-lambda-durable-functions` — >
- `aws-mcp-setup` — Configure AWS MCP servers for documentation search and API access. Use when setting up AWS MCP, configuring AWS documentation tools, troubleshooting MCP connectivity, or when user mentions aws-mcp, awsdocs, uvx setup, or MCP server configuration. Covers both Full AWS MCP Server (with uvx + credentials) and lightweight Documentation MCP (no auth required).
- `aws-serverless-deployment` — "AWS SAM and AWS CDK deployment for serverless applications. Triggers on phrases like: use SAM, SAM template, SAM init, SAM deploy, CDK serverless, CDK Lambda construct, NodejsFunction, PythonFunction, SAM and CDK together, serverless CI/CD pipeline. For general app deployment with service selection, use deploy-on-aws plugin instead."
- `aws-serverless-eda` — AWS serverless and event-driven architecture expert based on Well-Architected Framework. Use when building serverless APIs, Lambda functions, REST APIs, microservices, or async workflows. Covers Lambda with TypeScript/Python, API Gateway (REST/HTTP), DynamoDB, Step Functions, EventBridge, SQS, SNS, and serverless patterns. Essential when user mentions serverless, Lambda, API Gateway, event-driven, async processing, queues, pub/sub, or wants to build scalable serverless applications with AWS best practices.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shyswy/kiro-skills.git ~/.kiro-repo

# Symlink or copy to ~/.kiro
ln -sf ~/.kiro-repo/steering/* ~/.kiro/steering/
ln -sf ~/.kiro-repo/skills/* ~/.kiro/skills/
```

Or if this IS your `~/.kiro` directory:

```bash
cd ~/.kiro
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/shyswy/kiro-skills.git
git pull origin main
```

## Structure

```
~/.kiro/
├── steering/           # Steering files (auto-loaded by file type)
├── skills/             # Skills (loaded on-demand by trigger keywords)
├── projects/           # Project context (managed by project-context-manager)
├── scripts/            # Automation scripts
└── settings/           # MCP configs (gitignored, contains secrets)
```

## Customization

Edit `steering/user-scope-config.md` to update your environment. Use the `scope-manager` skill for guided updates.

## Auto-indexing

When a new skill is added, run:
```bash
bash scripts/update-skills-index.sh
```
Or it runs automatically via the `skill-index-updater` hook when SKILL.md files are created.
